# Dot files

Right now I am using Manjaro Linux on my Lenovo Thinkpad Xi Carbon laptop, and these are some (maybe most) of the dotfiles that I have for the programs that I use.  

I use Chezmoi to manage this.

Here is a list of some of the stuff but not all:

- Sway Window Manager
- Tmux
- Foot terminal
- Kitty terminal
- Vim
- NeoVim (it as AstroVim installed, but I dont use it a a lot, yet)
- Fish shell
- Zsh
- Starship prompt
